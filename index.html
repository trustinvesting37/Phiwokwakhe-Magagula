                        <h3 class="slogan">What is Bitcoin?</h3>
                        <p class="parrafo">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bitcoin is a 100% digital type of money. Anyone can use it from anywhere in the world. It is a universal currency that does not depend on any country.
<br>
There are no metal coins, paper bills, or plastic cards. It is used from computers or cell phones. In this way, transactions can be made 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
<br>
No government, person or company controls Bitcoin. It is simply a software protocol maintained by a global community of volunteers.
<br>
Users use it to send payments over the Internet, without banks or intermediaries. Transactions are made person-to-person without central bank control.
<br>
Users don't have to know each other. The system is neutral and works independently of the trust of the participants and without any controlling agent guaranteeing the transactions.
<br>
Bitcoin has qualities that make it superior to the money we know.
<br>
While it was designed to solve problems in our traditional financial system and bank inefficiencies, Satoshi also created a new kind of money. He is responsible for reinventing how money works!
<br>
Traditional money is issued and controlled by governments. In other words, it is a centralized currency. Bitcoin is not controlled by any entity, it is decentralized, it does not have an intermediary in transactions, it makes them cheaper, faster and easier.
<br>
It is not necessary to ask permission to use it, nobody can deny its use or close an account. The banks and the government are not in command of the government.
<br>
Furthermore, 2 billion people today do not have access to bank accounts and are excluded from the system. With Bitcoin, anyone can access financial services even without bank accounts. All you need is a smartphone and an internet connection.
<br>
Banknotes, credit cards and checks are vulnerable to fraud and counterfeiting. Having solved the problem of double spending, it means that no one can create fake Bitcoin. It is impossible to falsify or adulterate them.
<br>
Governments can create unlimited money. They print money when they need it to finance themselves. This decreases its value.
<br>
The sustained supply of a currency generates inflation. This makes the money we use worth less over time.
<br>
Bitcoin, however, has a fixed and limited supply. The Supply of Bitcoin Is Limited to 21 Million only. This means, although the world population is 7.9-Billion people, there's only 21-Million Bitcoins available. Think about the demand to grab just a small portion of it.
<br>
Since this is how it is programmed. It was designed to be a rare digital good.
<br>
The limited supply of Bitcoin generates the inverse effect of inflation, deflation. Bitcoin is intended to increase in value. This is one of the reasons why there are many investors interested in buying Bitcoin.
<br>
Traditional money can be spent in units of pennies, for example 8.99 or 2 decimal places. But Bitcoin can be spent in much smaller amounts, called Satoshis, down to 8 decimal places. This means that much smaller and more precise purchases can be made.
<br>
It is necessary that it be so divisible since it is designed so that its value increases over time. For example, today a brand new car can cost 0.1 btc. But in the future it may cost 0.00000001 btc.
<br>
Bitcoin is very valuable. That is why it must be very safe or we can also say that it is very safe and that is why it is very valuable.
<br>
Bitcoin uses cryptography to process payments securely. That is why Bitcoin is called a cryptocurrency.
<br>
Cryptography is a technology that protects information by encoding it using complex mathematical functions. Bitcoin's security model is very powerful and protects the integrity of account balances and their transactions. The security protocol is so strong that it is inviolable. There is a lot of money stored in Bitcoin and no one has ever been able to Hack it.</p>

                        <p class="parrafo">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The answer is no.</b> Scams have always existed in all types of businesses, even the most legal and safe ones. That is why Trust Investing has been protected with valid registrations and legal contracts, backed by International Commercial Standards.</p>
                        <p class="parrafo">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to design a masterful scam system that lasted many years was<strong> Carles Ponzi (1919).</strong></p>
                        <p class="parrafo">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second most famous large-scale fraud very similar to the first was that of Bernie Madoff (1990 to 2007). Hence the famous “ponzi schemes”.</p>
                        <p class="parrafo">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely you will hear on YouTube and some web pages that Trust Investing is a “Ponzi scheme o Pyramid Scheme”, <strong>and the truth is, these people are either not informed, or they use marketing so that their published article has more visits,</strong> they use different techniques such as the curiosity gap (Example: “Trust Investing will be a scam”) and then <strong>tell the public what they want to hear, they get likes, attention and you are left without a project to achieve your financial freedom.</strong> </p>
                        <p class="parrafo">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the truth is that for the most part, these people who tell you this, <strong>they have not given Trust Investing the opportunity or they simply want to promote you another business.</strong></p>
